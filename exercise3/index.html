  <u><h2>About</h2></u>
  <p>Mr. Potato Head (or Potato Head for short) is a supporting character in the Toy Story franchise. He is a moody, crabby toy based on the famous Mr. Potato Head toy from Playskool.

    Though he can be sarcastic, cynical, jealous, and sometimes unfriendly and rude, he has a heart of gold deep down and is prepared to go to limitless lengths to save his friends.

    Mr. Potato Head is partners with Hamm as they are seen high-fiving each other whenever something exciting or victorious happens.

    Mr. Potato Head demonstrates the unique ability to separate his body parts from his plastic body. He has eyes, pink ears, white arms with gloves, two pairs of blue shoes (one extra), a red mouth, an orange nose, black eyebrows, a black mustache, a black bowler hat and a pair of angry eyes.
    In the first film, Toy Story (1995), Mr. Potato Head is shown to be very moody towards Andy's other toys, although he is good friends with Hamm the piggy bank (John Ratzenberger). When Sheriff Woody (Tom Hanks) accidentally pushes Buzz Lightyear (Tim Allen) out of a window, Potato Head accuses Woody of doing it on purpose. At the end of the movie, he is overjoyed to hear Andy's sister Molly getting a Mrs. Potato Head on Christmas.

In the second film, Toy Story 2 (1999), Mr. Potato Head goes with Andy's other toys to rescue Woody after he is stolen by Al McWhiggin (Wayne Knight). After Mr. Potato Head saves three Alien toys (Jeff Pidgeon) from falling out of a Pizza Planet truck, his wife, Mrs. Potato Head (Estelle Harris) adopts them, making her husband upset.

In the third film, Toy Story 3 (2010), Mr. Potato Head is one of Andy's remaining toys, alongside his wife, the Aliens, and others. The toys are donated to a daycare center and are later almost killed in a landfill incinerator. When the Aliens rescue the toys with a giant crane, Mr. Potato Head finally accepts them as his sons. Eventually, Mr. Potato Head and his friends are donated to a new owner named Bonnie (Emily Hahn).

Mr. Potato Head has appeared in all three Toy Story Toons shorts: Hawaiian Vacation (2011), Small Fry (2011), and Partysaurus Rex (2012), with Rickles reprising the role in the first and third shorts.

Mr. Potato Head also appeared in the Halloween special Toy Story of Terror! (2013), where he disappears and Bonnie's other toys must find him.

Mr. Potato Head appeared in the Christmas special, Toy Story That Time Forgot (2014), which was also Rickles' final performance as the character.[16]

Mr. Potato Head appeared in the fourth film Toy Story 4 (2019).[17] However, Rickles died in 2017, and did not record any lines for the film.[18] But with permission from Rickles' family, Pixar used unreleased lines that Rickles recorded in previous Toy Story films.[19]
